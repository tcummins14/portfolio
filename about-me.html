      <p>With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in fine arts, I have over 15 years experience as a graphic designer and print production specialist  using InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Microsoft Office products.</p>

      <p>In my career, I have played a key role in the design and production of many different projects. I started with modest means to learn production basics, such as scanning, color correction, and prepress. As art director of popular magazines, I designed print layouts and collaborated with media outlets. With a Secret Security Clearance from the U.S. Government, I worked with high-ranking officials to publish sensitive reports and the U.S. Army Branding department to promote twenty-first century marketing materials. I have worked in quick turn-around environments and juggled multiple projects while coordinating with staff and clients.</p>

      <p>I continue to educate myself in web design and digital media to keep up-to-date with the latest design trends and specifications, and volunteer my time and skills to multiple non-profit organizations that need help creating their visual presence.
My experience is well rounded, together with design skills that are unique and fresh from print to web, to guarantee beautiful as well as functional digital files. I am a dedicated, dependable person with excellent verbal and technical writing skills and a strong initiative to propel any organization to greater success.</p>
